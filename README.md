# About
This repository contains the code needed to run the python service to detect motion, 
take a photo and send the photo for processing to the security-micro-service to determine whether the detected
motion came from a person or not as part of the [Security with Machine Learning Spice Makes Everything Nice](https://medium.com/dvt-engineering/security-with-machine-learning-spice-makes-everything-nice-778c1c3011b5) project.

# System Requirements
* Docker and Docker compose for Raspberry Pi - [How To Install Docker and Docker-Compose On Raspberry Pi](https://dev.to/elalemanyo/how-to-install-docker-and-docker-compose-on-raspberry-pi-1mo) 
* Raspbian 11 (bullseye) OS version - [Install Raspberry Pi OS Bullseye on Raspberry Pi (Illustrative Guide)](https://raspberrytips.com/install-raspbian-raspberry-pi/)
* Git  - [How to Install Git on Raspberry Pi](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-git-on-raspberry-pi/)

# Pre-Requisites
A docker swarm manager node needs to exist before proceeding. You will also need to know the token to join the swarm as a worker. If you do not yet have a host designated as a manager, the steps below 
need to be followed to create one:

1. On the host designated as the manager, assign a static I.P. address to the host
   * if you opted to use a host running Ubuntu to be the manager, please follow the guide [Ubuntu Static I.P. Address](https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-configure-static-ip-address-on-ubuntu-18-10-cosmic-cuttlefish-linux#:~:text=Ubuntu%20Desktop,-The%20simplest%20approach&text=Click%20on%20the%20top%20right,netmask%2C%20gateway%20and%20DNS%20settings.) to set it up.
   * For a Raspberry Pi host please see [How to Setup a Raspberry Pi Static IP Address](https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-static-ip-address/)
   * For a Windows 10 machine - [How to Assign a Static IP Address in Windows 7, 8, 10, XP, or Vista](https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/19249/how-to-assign-a-static-ip-address-in-xp-vista-or-windows-7/)
2. execute the command `docker swarm init --advertise-addrr <static-ip-address-from-step-1>`
3. You will be presented with the token to be used to join the swarm as workers - note this command to be run later.

# Usage
1. On the Raspberry Pi that will run this service, join the docker swarm using the command noted in step 3 of the pre-requisite section
2. Clone this repository onto your Raspberry Pi
3. Navigate to the directory containing the docker-compose file
4. If other configurations are needed, you can update the relevant environment variable (but the default should suffice if you are following along with the [Security with Machine Learning Spice Makes Everything Nice](https://medium.com/dvt-engineering/security-with-machine-learning-spice-makes-everything-nice-778c1c3011b5) project)
5. Execute `docker-compose up -d` in the same directory as the `docker-compose.yml` file
